Dear Diary,

Today, I set forth on a journey that's been a distant dream, a yearning in the depths of my soul. The rhythmic hiss of steam from the bike's pipes serenades me as I navigate through the mist-shrouded streets of the city I've called home my entire life. There's an undeniable mix of anticipation and uncertainty in the air.

Sara Ruiz, that's me. A face in the crowd, a familiar presence in the daily grind of a city that's seen me through hotel shifts and administrative duties. Yet, as the gears of progress turn, my city transforms, becoming a place that feels less like home with each passing day.

The fog blankets the familiar cobblestones, creating an enigmatic atmosphere that mirrors the ambiguity of my departure. I've saved enough to secure a steam-powered bike, and with it, I leave behind the comfort of routine for a journey into the unknown.

As the wheels of my bike turn, I can't shake the feeling of leaving something behind – a piece of me embedded in the brick and mortar of this evolving city. It's bittersweet, the realization that in seeking something more, I'm also saying goodbye to a place that's shaped me.

The fog seems to swallow the echoes of the city, muffling the sounds that once felt like a heartbeat. I don't have a clear destination, only a yearning for the unfamiliar and a desire to rediscover the sense of belonging that's slipped away.

The road stretches ahead, disappearing into a misty horizon, and I can't help but reflect on the paradox of leaving what I know and love. There's a part of me that will undoubtedly miss the city, its quirks, and the memories etched into its alleys.

But deep down, I sense that this departure is a necessary step. The city, as it stands now, no longer resonates with the person I've become. The misty road beckons, and with each mile, I hope to find a new chapter – a place that feels like home in a way my city once did.

Onward into the unknown,
Sara Ruiz
